        "The General Social Survey (GSS) is a bi-annual nationally representative survey of Americans, with almost 7000 different questions asked since the survey began in the 1970s. It has straightforward questions about respondents' demographic information, but also questions like \"Does your job regularly require you to perform repetitive or forceful hand movements or involve awkward postures?\" or \"How often do the demands of your job interfere with your family life?\" There are a variety of controversial questions. No matter what you're curious about, there's something interesting in here to check out. The codebook is 904 pages (use CTRL+F to search it).\n",

        "Here is your task:\n",
        "1. Download a small (5-15) set of variables of interest. (You can also check out `get_gss.ipynb` for some processed data.)\n",
        "2. Write a short description of the data you chose, and why. (~500 words)\n",
        "3. Load the data using Pandas. Clean them up for EDA. Do this in this notebook with comments or markdown chunks explaining your choices.\n",
        "4. Produce some numeric summaries and visualizations.\n",
        "5. Describe your findings. (500 - 1000 words, or more)\n",

        "For example, you might want to look at how aspects of a person's childhood family are correlated or not with their career or family choices as an adult. Or how political or religious affiliations correlate with drug use or sexual practices. It's an extremely wide-ranging survey.\n"

        "We chose 10 variables to feature in our dataset: year, id, wrkstat, prestige, occ, educ, sex, race, rincome, and polviews. We chose the year variable as it tracks trends over time and is useful to analyze how opinions/demographics have changed over time. We chose the ID variable as it is a unique identifier for respondents and can allow us to clean/merge the data while maintaining individual data indexes. We chose wrkstat as it shows if someone's employment level and could have a relationship with income, education, prestige, etc. We chose prestige as it measures the social standing of jobs, it can be useful for connecting occupation, education, and other factors to social class. We chose occ to get specific occupation information, we can get specifics about industires and job types. We chose educ to see the years of education individuals have, this is a key socioeconomic variable. We chose sex to analyze the differences in our data across genders. We chose race to analyze inequality and see if there are relationships between our data and race. We chose rincome as it is a direct measure of financial ability and likely has relationships with occupation, education, and more. Finally, our last variable is polviews to analyze how political views align with certain demographics and social positions.\n",

Work status v. gender, are men and women equally represented in full-time work? Presitge v. politics, are higher-prestige jobs associated with a particular political group? Race v. education, are there gaps in average education by race and how have they changed over time? Income v. political views, is there a relationship between political views and high earners?"
